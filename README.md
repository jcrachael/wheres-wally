## To dos:

1. Transfer `levels` data to Firebase
2. Check if leaderboard variable in `App.js` is required
3. Check if the `useEffect()` that gets the leaderboard and topScores data on initial render in `App.js` is required; bugfix the infinite loop that makes infinite calls to Firebase
4. Implement level 2
